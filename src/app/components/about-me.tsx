                            I&apos;m a frontend developer based in Essex, UK,
                            with a focus on building user-friendly web
                            experiences using modern technologies. I have
                            experience with frameworks like React and Ember, and
                            while my strength lies in frontend work, I also have
                            a solid understanding of backend systems, helping me
                            collaborate effectively across the full stack.
                            I&apos;m familiar with Agile methodologies and apply
                            OOP and SOLID principles to write clean,
                            maintainable code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, Iâ€™ve delivered high-quality
                            solutions across both in-house and freelance
                            projects, working closely with developers,
                            designers, and project managers. I&apos;m committed
                            to continuous improvement through self-funded
                            training and real-world problem-solving, and I aim
                            to create thoughtful digital experiences while
                            staying adaptable and curious in everything I do.
